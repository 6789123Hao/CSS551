    <p><b><u>App Name: ARCore Crane Game</u></b></p> 
   <p>A game in which the user controls a crane to pick up presents that are scattered around the user's environment within a time limit.
	The collectable objects that the user attempts to pick up with the crane move 
	back and forth at random speeds; new presents are inserted into the scene every 2.5 seconds or after the crane picks up an object.
	The user rotates the crane by tapping on each of its segments and dragging their
	finger across the screen. The crane is scaled by doing a pinch-to-zoom gesture. The user sees what is in front of the crane's head via the second viewport which displays a camera
	view outwards from
	the crane's head. The crane's head also illuminates the presents via point lighting and the crane in general is lit via ARCore lighting estimation. Occlusion via ARCore Depth API
	is included to acheive depth perception, and can be enabled or disabled by the user. 
	At the end of the game, the user's score (number of collected items) is displayed, and the user can start over.
