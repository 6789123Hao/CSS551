<h3><strong>Download and Installation</strong></h3>
<p>Unity download and install: work with the latest, all examples in class are based on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Unity-2021.3.10f1</strong></span> (LTS: Long Term Support releases):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases">https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases</a>. (the first one the list)
</li>
<li>If you prefer working with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> (thanks to Shaun Stangler for sharing the link), 
you can <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity">follow this link to switch your IDE</a>. 
</ul>
<h3><strong>Begin working with Unity</strong></h3>
<p>Installation, the editor, and tutorials, go over this yourself after class:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/get-started-with-the-unity-hub">Get started with Unity Hub        </a></li>
    <li>Manual pages: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityOverview.html">Overview.</a> 
        You <b>MUST</b> look at 
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheEditor.html">how to use the editor</a>. </li>
            <li>If you like/have time: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/EditorFeatures.html">you can look at details of the edtior features</a> (I don't know most of these, and I am surviving). </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> After you know what the editor is about, 
        take a look at <a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorials">https://learn.unity.com/tutorials</a>:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/session-1-unity-essentials-live-mar-22-2021">Unity Essentials</a></li>
            <li>Take a <i>very</i>quick look at: <a href="https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer"> Junior Programmer</a> (the first or two sessions would be more than enough)</li>
            <li>Remember, you are not learning how to build a game, rather, you want to be able to use Unity, that's all.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Documentations: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html">https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html</a>
        <ul>
